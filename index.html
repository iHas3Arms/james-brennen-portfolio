                Welcome! I'm <strong class="darker">James</strong> - the programmer in question. 
                I would like to welcome to you to my website 
                <strong class="darker">which I coded myself from scratch</strong> 
                using no external libraries. I have been in love with coding and learning 
                of computers and such since the days I was 11 (which, at the time of 
                writing, was 2 years ago). Snoop around and you'll find a selection 
                of projects I have made along the way, as well as more about me as a person. 
                To start that off, I will tell you that I whole-heartedly believe in 
                committing to my task with as much focus as humanly possible. I am a 
                hard-worker and will not stop learning until the day pigs fly. Find out more 
                below!

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p class="my-skills-text">
            Here I will tell you all the skills I have collected over the 13 years of my 
            life surrounded by great friends, family, and role models.
            <br>
            <br>
            As you have seen above, I like learning more than one thing at once. 
            This is helpful because studies have shown that trying to learn and focus 
            on multiple things at the same time fires more neurons and therefore means 
            you learn more, faster. This also shows that I am a very capable worker 
            who is willing to push myself to the absolute limits and never give up 
            trying to be the best. Whether I know a language or not, I always try 
            to learn more about it and read the documentation to get more information 
            and progress one step further to being the best.
            <br>
            <br>
            Talking of languages, I am multilingual. I speak English, Spanish, and Romanian. 
            This indeed is a skill, not a brag, as it means I can organise deals and 
            win the affection of foreign businesses and companies we would like to make 
            deals with and have them appreciate the fact that the business they're talking 
            to has someone that has learnt their native language.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my learning capabilities, I am an extremely inquisitive fellow 
            which many would say is a great personality. I always want to learn more, 
            once I'm hooked on something, I try to learn as much as possible about the 
            subject. This could be seen as a weakness in some scenarios, and I will admit, 
            it has become one in some situations. However, I believe that the positives of 
            this trait outweigh the negatives in great ratio.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, I have always been interested in technology. And I'm not talking about 
            the typical Gen Z person, who is always on their phone, excited about the next 
            iPhone release, who plays Fortnite ritually (which I personally don't see the 
            hype of anymore, but to each their own, I suppose). I'm talking about it in the 
            sense that I have always wanted to achieve a greater understanding about the 
            world that we live in and how to control it, and with the world being filled 
            to the brim with electronics these days, it is what I have taken a liking to. 
            I want to learn how to make it do things, how a Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
            actually does what it can do, what threads are, what channels are, what a chipset 
            is, how to make one of these motherboards or CPUs, and so on, I want to gain a 
            deeper appreciation of what we use everyday, and how I can use it to affect 
            someone's life in a positive way. I always want to help people, even if it means 
            putting myself at a disadvantage, and coding might be the best way I can.
            <br>
            <br> 
            So if you find someone else who is currently better than me at what I know and much 
            more, then... great! I'm glad you found someone you are happy with! But if  you 
            want someone with so much grit, and determination, that they would not stop until 
            the phrase, "I am the best at what I do," would indeed not be false... 
            <br>
            <br>
            choose me.
